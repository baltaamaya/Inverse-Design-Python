This is an introduction of how to use git with windows subsystem linux

1) open ubuntu bash, and configure your git account:

	git config --global user.email "<put your email here>"
	git config --global user.name "<put your username here>"

2) In the teminal navigate to where you want to save the repository, preferrably inside of the windows file system if you want to view pictures

	cd /mnt/c/Users/....

3) Clone the repository

	git clone https://github.com/EmericDeylgat/Inverse-Design.git

   It will ask for your username and password

4) Now check if it actually got cloned into that dorectory you wanted, it should be there
   Also get into the repository on your computer	
	
	cd Inverse-Design

5) I ve already made a new branch called 90-10-mmi, to avoid accidentally committing to the master branch use:
		
	git checkout 90-10-mmi		 
   
   Now a new file named 90-10-mmi.py should have appeard in the directory 
   In this file you should work and commit things, later when it is ready we then going to merge this branch with the master branch

6) When you have worked on the file don't forget to commit and push your changes to the repository
   But before if you want you can check what files have changed and what is currently inside of the commit with:
	
	git status

   If the file and are highlighted in red this means that you still have to add them to the commit. This is done by:
	
	git add 90-10-mmi.py (or any other new file you'd like to commit)
   
   Then commit and push your changes

	git commit -m "<put some message here, maybe short description of what you have done>"
	push -u origin 90-10-mmi

7) Check online if it worked 

8) To get the work that someone else has done and merge it yours: use 

	git pull origin

   
BTW all these commands are to be executed while you are in the windows folder of Inverse-Design
